## Motivation
One of the most attractive features that Singapore has is the abundance of greenery and parks that blend seamlessly with its urban landscape. We hope to promote these attractions to encourage more visitors and locals alike to experience our “City in a Garden”, which is a commitment that will remain a top priority as part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030.
It is also important to recognize that these green spaces in Singapore constantly change and evolve. Our solution remains relevant to constantly retrieve highly rated spaces from google reviews.
Besides scenic route recommendations, the scope of this app can also be widened to provide recommendations based on the user’s requirement, e.g., supermarkets, petrol stations, EV charging stations, cafés, etc.
